    <h1> Project 1: Snake Game</h1>

   <br>
 <p1> For the first game I made a snake game! Instead of snake there are turtles, when the turtle collides with the red apple a new turtle is added to the back of the head turtle. If you leave the boundeies or crash into the snake of turtles, it resets and you lose! </p1>

 <h1> Project 2: Memory Card Game </h1>

   <br>
 <p1> For the PLTW 1.2.5 Project, we made a memory card game. The game opens up to the menu where it presents 4 buttons: 12 cards, 18 cards, 20 cards, and instructions. When you click instructions, it opens up to a page that has a list of how to play, it also has an exit button to take you back to the main menu page. Then you seleet an amount of cards where it will present you with that many cards flipped down and Player 1 and Player 2 will take turns to flip over cards hoping for a match. Every time a player gets a match a point is added and then the player gets to go again until they mismatch. Every time 2 cards are selected that do not match, they flipped back over. After all cards are flipped, the player with the most points is annoucnced.   </p1>

 <p1> This game is a casino game that is quite popular. When first opening up the game the player will start with no money and enter the casino. Then, they will spin the slot machine where they will get a randomized spin which cost 30 dollars. Depending on the results of the spin, the player will either have a lose (because they spent 30 dollars to spin). Make a 20 dollar profit by receiving 50 dollars if the player’s spin shows up with      2 of the same pictures in a row (they win). Make a 70 dollar profit by receiving 100 dollars if the player’s spin shows up with 3 of the same pictures in a row. (They win).  </p1>

 <h1> Desert Plains </h1>

   <br>
 <p1> We divided the data into four groups based on how the data appeared and how many numbers there were, and then created graphs for each of the data columns. After that, we compared the planet's conditions to the four graphs. To figure out which planet it is, we employed a process of elimination. We first eliminated low and constant because nothing was low for movement. Then we removed low for sound because there was nothing else that matched for that sensor that was low. After doing all of that, we came up with Desert Plains as our answer.

<h1>Project 5: Making Meaning from Data</h1>
  <br>
 <img src="images/3.2.4.JPG" height="450">
  <br>
<p1> The main goal of this project was to make meaning of a large group of data and some of the data that was given had to do with each state and the amount of honey each state uses. This project was to take that data and interpret it using python code to analyze the data and print specific information for each of the states. One of the details that was printed was the sum of all the per year honey values from each state and another printed detail was the average. The code also took the data and split it up into different graphs based off the range to see which states used the most honey. </p1>

<h1>Project 6: Understanding Complex Systems</h1>
  <br>
 <img src="images/Trials.PNG" height="450">
  <br>
<p1> The main goal of this project was to understand complex situation and showing how you can showcase certain situtions through online simulations. This is hsown through different algorithms that are implimented in a model and then analyzed to help show the outcome with certain factors. We interpreted and broke down the understanding of a trails simulation and how many people would pass through the trails and the amount of people and speed could be shown through the simulation.</p1>
