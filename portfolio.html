 <h1> For the first game I made a snake game! Instead of snake there are turtles, when the turtle collides with the red apple a new turtle is added to the back of the head turtle. If you leave the boundeies or crash into the snake of turtles, it resets and you lose! </h1>

 <h1> Foe the PLTW 1.2.5 Project, we made a memory card game. The game opens up to the menu where it presents 4 buttons: 12 cards, 18 cards, 20 cards, and instructions. When you click instructions, it opens up to a page that has a list of how to play, it also has an exit button to take you back to the main menu page. Then you seleet an amount of cards where it will present you with that many cards flipped down and Player 1 and Player 2 will take turns to flip over cards hoping for a match. Every time a player gets a match a point is added and then the player gets to go again until they mismatch. Every time 2 cards are selected that do not match, they flipped back over. After all cards are flipped, the player with the most points is annoucnced.   </h1>
